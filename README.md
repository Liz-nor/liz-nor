# Hi there 👋

### My name is Lise (also know as Liz to my friends around the world🌍) and I am a Frontend developer student.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my last year of Frontend development.
- 🌱 I’m desperatly trying to learn JavaScript but find it really challenging (but hey, thats what we are here for right?)
- 🤔 I’m looking for an opportunity to develop technology that helps the elderly and people with dementia live at home for longer.
- 💬 Ask me about anything but dont always expect a straight answer🤭
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I previously used to stream and  want to pick this up again after my studies are finished🎮

## Hi there 👋

My name is Lise (also know as Liz to my friends around the world🌍) and I am a Frontend developer student.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting through my Portfolio to showcase my previous projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
- 🤔 I’m looking for an opportunity to develop technology that helps the elderly and people with dementia live at home for longer.
- 💬 Ask me about anything but dont always excpect a straight answer🤭
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I previously used to stream and  want to pick this up again after my studies are finished🎮
